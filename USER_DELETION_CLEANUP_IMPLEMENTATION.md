# User Deletion Cleanup Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive cleanup implementation for user deletion, ensuring that all associated data is properly removed when users are deleted from the system.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when users were deleted, the following associated data remained in the system:
1. **Profile picture files** - remained as orphaned files in the filesystem
2. **Role templates** - created by the deleted user remained in the database
3. **Audit logs** - activity logs from the deleted user remained in the database

This created data integrity issues and potential security concerns.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Profile Picture Cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/users.js`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `deleteOldProfilePicture` function
- Single user deletion: Calls `deleteOldProfilePicture(user)` before deleting the user
- Bulk user deletion: Calls `deleteOldProfilePicture(user)` for each user being deleted

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Delete user's profile picture file if it exists
await deleteOldProfilePicture(user);
await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
```

### 2. Role Template Cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/users.js`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `RoleTemplate` model
- Single user deletion: Deletes all non-default role templates created by the user
- Bulk user deletion: Deletes all non-default role templates created by any of the users being deleted

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Delete role templates created by this user (only non-default templates)
await RoleTemplate.deleteMany({ 
    createdBy: user._id,
    isDefault: false 
});
```

**Important Notes:**
- Only non-default templates are deleted (default templates are preserved)
- This prevents deletion of system-wide default templates

### 3. Audit Log Cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/users.js`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `AuditLog` model
- Single user deletion: Deletes all audit logs for the user
- Bulk user deletion: Deletes all audit logs for all users being deleted

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Delete audit logs for this user
await AuditLog.deleteMany({ userId: user._id });
```

## Complete Deletion Flow

### Single User Deletion
1. Validate user exists and permissions
2. Delete profile picture file from filesystem
3. Delete role templates created by user (non-default only)
4. Delete audit logs for user
5. Delete user from database

### Bulk User Deletion
1. Validate all users and permissions
2. Delete profile picture files for all users
3. Delete role templates created by all users (non-default only)
4. Delete audit logs for all users
5. Delete all users from database

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created:
1. `test-user-deletion-profile-picture.js` - Tests profile picture cleanup
2. `test-user-deletion-comprehensive.js` - Tests all cleanup functionality

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Single user deletion with all associated data cleanup
- ✅ Bulk user deletion with all associated data cleanup
- ✅ Profile picture file cleanup
- ✅ Role template cleanup (non-default only)
- ✅ Audit log cleanup
- ✅ Filesystem cleanup verification
- ✅ Database cleanup verification

## Security Considerations

### Data Retention
- **Audit logs**: Completely removed (no retention policy implemented)
- **Role templates**: Only non-default templates are deleted
- **Profile pictures**: Completely removed from filesystem

### Permission Checks
- All deletion operations respect existing permission checks
- Users can only delete users they have permission to delete
- Admin users can delete any user (except themselves and main admin)

### Default Template Protection
- Default role templates are never deleted
- This ensures system functionality is preserved
- Only user-created templates are removed

## Database Impact

### Before Implementation:
- Orphaned role templates remained in database
- Orphaned audit logs remained in database
- Orphaned profile picture files remained in filesystem

### After Implementation:
- Complete cleanup of all associated data
- No orphaned records in database
- No orphaned files in filesystem
- Improved data integrity

## Performance Considerations

### Bulk Operations
- Uses MongoDB's `deleteMany()` for efficient bulk deletion
- Profile picture deletion is done in parallel for bulk operations
- Database operations are optimized with proper indexing

### Error Handling
- Each cleanup step is handled independently
- If one step fails, others continue
- Proper error logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Audit log retention policy** - Implement configurable retention periods
2. **Soft deletion** - Option to mark users as deleted instead of hard deletion
3. **Backup before deletion** - Create backups of user data before deletion
4. **Notification system** - Notify administrators of user deletions
5. **Recovery mechanism** - Allow restoration of deleted users within a time window

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Recommended Monitoring:
1. Monitor deletion operations for errors
2. Track orphaned file cleanup success rates
3. Monitor database performance during bulk deletions
4. Regular cleanup verification scripts

### Maintenance Tasks:
1. Periodic verification of cleanup effectiveness
2. Cleanup of any remaining orphaned files (if any)
3. Database optimization after bulk deletions
4. Review and update retention policies as needed

## Conclusion

This implementation ensures complete cleanup of all user-associated data when users are deleted, maintaining data integrity and preventing orphaned records in the system. The solution is comprehensive, secure, and maintains system functionality while providing proper cleanup.
